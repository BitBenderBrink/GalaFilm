# GalaFilm
This is a repository for the Gala Film Organization, primarily for public documents. 

Please note that the most up-to-date version is always going the be the markdown version, so if you see a .pdf file that is not newer than the last markdown file, it has been supersceded by the markdown and will be modified at a later date. This document is designed to be a living document which the community can help refine and develop. The Gala Film proposition is entirely unique in the Gala Ecosystem at this point in time, and we look forward to seeing it grow and evolve as the community grows and evolves. 

Happy watching!
